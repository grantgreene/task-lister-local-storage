Task Lister is a simple task tracking app that let's you add tasks you that you are looking to keep track of.

You are able to change the status of tasks to "to-do", "in progress", "waiting", and "completed". Once you finish a task and mark it completed, you can delete it when you no longer need to see it.

You, also, have the availability to filter, sort, or search by any of the available columns.

The tasks are saved to local storage, so as long as your local storage is preserved, your tasks will be preserved as well.
